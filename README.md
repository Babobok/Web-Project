            Eleceed (One of my favorite WEBTOON comics, this explains it a little}
            <br>
            <br>
                Jiwoo is a kind-hearted young man who harnesses the lightning quick reflexes of a cat to secretly make the world a better place – one saved little child or foster pet at a time. Kayden is a secret agent on the run, who finds himself stuck in the body of a…um…decidedly fat old fluffy cat. Together, armed with Jiwoo's super powers and Kayden's uber-smarts, they're out to fight those forces who would let evil rule this world. That is, if they can stand each other long enough to get the job done.

But John's got a secret past that threatens to bring down the school's whole social order – and much more. Fulfilling his destiny won't be easy though, because there are battles, frenemies and deadly conspiracies around every corner.

With one last chance to right everything, she comes up with a plan: train her spoiled sibling to be the next ruler by becoming an even bigger brat and get Aaron Vestein, the most beautiful man in the empire, to replace her fiancé!

Theresa, however, has her own goals, and that is to find the white-haired knight. She'll make any sacrifice to do so.
